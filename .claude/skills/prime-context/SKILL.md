Here are all standards and architecture docs for the SkillForge codebase. These include monorepo structure, tech stack, domain models, database patterns (Drizzle ORM + SQLite), connector adapters, and UI component conventions.

Follow the project standards strictly. Verify that all code adheres to the documented standards before considering a task complete.

For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.

Just reply "Ready!" then continue what you were doing.
